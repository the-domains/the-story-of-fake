# Reader beware
![L'Opéra Royal du Château de Versailles](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/cb973288-c43a-4a46-935b-17a77e1a722f.jpg)

Back in 1987 (or was it 1984?) I was visiting Versailles. I do not remember much of that visit, but one thing stuck in my mind that has been poking me regularly to be properly explored: the marble at the opera was a total fake.

As I recall, the architect was a slacker and waited too long to start construction. So, in a rush, he made the opera in plaster and wood, painting the wood to look like marble. [Faux marble][0].

But the real kicker was that, as the tour guide explained, the architect painted the marble with veins and spots. Marble has veins OR spots, not both together.

I thought that was humorous. But it also made me think a lot since then about the nature of Fake.

What is Fake? Why do we have Fake? What is the purpose of Fake? Where do we see Fake? What is the psychology of Fake? 

I've spent the last 30 years of so picking up examples of fake and think it's time I finally write them down and provide a real discussion of Fake.

Care to join me?
